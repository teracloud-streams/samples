# Teracloud Streams Application Samples

This repository contains sample applications for Teracloud Streams (formerly IBM Streams). The samples are compatible with Teracloud Streams releases beginning with release 7.1.   

To learn more about Streams:
* [Teracloud Streams website](https://streams.teracloud.com/)
* [Teracloud Streams development documentation](https://doc.streams.teracloud.com/com.ibm.streams.dev.doc/doc/dev-container.html)

## Before you begin

* Follow the Streams App Developer docs to learn about Teracloud Streams stream applications, operators, and Streams Processing Language (SPL).
* Install Teracloud Streams (or use an existing installation that you have access to).
* Additionally, you'll need to chose a development tool (VS Code or command-line) and get a development environment set up.


## Next steps
Refer to the [Build, Run, View Guide](BuildRunView.md) for more specific information about how to work with the samples.

Select a sample to begin.  If you're new to Teracloud Streams, the applications under **Examples-for-beginners** is a great place to start

> [**NOTE**]
> Check the `requiredProductVersion` value in the `info.xml` of the sample to see if your version of Streams can run the sample. Samples using newer features may require a newer version of Streams.
