## Overview
This example shows off yet another powerful standard toolkit operator named
the Aggregate. It is very good in computing on the fly aggregate values by
collecting a set of tuples. Tuples are grouped based on tumbling and sliding
windows with partitioned variants. This example also shows how to use the
built-in assignment functions provided by this operator to compute regular
statistical calculations such as min, max, average, standard deviation etc.
