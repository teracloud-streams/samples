## Overview
This example demonstrates an utility operator called Union. This operator combines all the tuples from several input ports as they arrive and emits a single output stream. All the input ports must have a schema that contains attributes of the same name and type as that of the output port. The order of the attributes in the input ports need not match the order in the output port.
