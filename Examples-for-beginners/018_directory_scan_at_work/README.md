## Overview
This example demonstrates one of the important features desired in the real-world (mostly in the retail banking and in the telco industries).  In many real-world scenarios, they still work via files that get dropped into a directory for processing. It is shown here how the DirectoryScan operator picks up a file as soon as it appears inside an input directory.

**Please Note:** There are some file manipulation steps you need to perform to fully run this sample. Please refer to the comments in the source code for instructions.
