## Overview
This example shows how helper and utility functions can be written using the SPL language. It also shows how those SPL functions can be put to use inside the context of an application. Learning this simple concept will go a long way in doing a lot of neat stuff in real-world applications.

All the SPL functions to perform different arithmetic calculations are defined in a separate SPL file (Calculator.spl) in this project directory.

In this sample, building the main composite (in Main.spl) pulls the other .spl file into the build.

For more information about how to compile, execute and view the output of a sample application, see the [Build, Run, View Guide](../../BuildRunView.md)

## Code
Application code is located in:
* my.sample/Main.spl
* my.sample/Calculator.spl

## Output
