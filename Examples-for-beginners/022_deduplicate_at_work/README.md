## Overview
This example describes the use of an important operator that is highly applicable in many telco scenarios. That operator is called DeDuplicate, which eliminates duplicate tuples for a specified duration of time. It has two output ports. In the first output port, all the non-duplicate tuples are sent. In the optional second output port, all the duplicate tuples are sent.
