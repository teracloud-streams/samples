## Overview
This example shows how one can use the MetricsSink standard toolkit operator to create application-specific custom metrics that can be viewed in real-time when the application is running. The viewing of the custom metrics can be performed in the Streams Console or by using the capturestate option in streamtool.

**Please Note:  This sample does not support Standalone mode.**
