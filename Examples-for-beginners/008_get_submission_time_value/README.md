## Overview
This example shows how the tuple attributes can be assigned values that were supplied by the user at the application/job submission time. It employs the getSubmissionTimeValue function to obtain different values made of different SPL data types.

If you launch this application from VS Code or the Streams Console, you can enter the submission time values in the application launch dialog.

You have to provide four different parameters. Some parameters are expected as a list as shown below.

param1=10
param2=56
param3=45,46,47
param4=67,68
