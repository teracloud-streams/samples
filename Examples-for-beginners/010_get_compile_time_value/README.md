## Overview
This example shows how arguments supplied during the application compile time can be accessed inside of the SPL applications.

In the Streams Extension for VS Code, these values can be entered by using the **Build with Parameters** action on the Main.spl file.

If you're building from the command line, the values are supplied in the Makefile as compiler arguments.

For more information about how to compile, execute and view the output of a sample application, see the [Build, Run, View Guide](../../BuildRunView.md)
