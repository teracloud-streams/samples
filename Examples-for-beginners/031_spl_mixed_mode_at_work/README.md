## Overview
This example shows a cool SPL feature called mixed-mode support. In this, developers can mix PERL code islands inside of an SPL application. Mixed-mode enables the easy parameterization of SPL applications. This example gives a small flavor of how a PERL code snippet inter-mixed with SPL allows us to parameterize the SPL Stream names and the number of output stream definitions for an SPL operator.

For more information about how to compile, execute and view the output of a sample application, see the [Build, Run, View Guide](../../BuildRunView.md)
