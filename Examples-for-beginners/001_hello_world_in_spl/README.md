## Overview
This example is the simplest possible SPL application.  It uses a Beacon operator to generate tuples that carry "Hello World" messages. A custom sink operator receives the tuples from Beacon and displays it on the console.

For more information about how to compile, execute and view the output of a sample application, see the [Build, Run, View Guide](../../BuildRunView.md)
